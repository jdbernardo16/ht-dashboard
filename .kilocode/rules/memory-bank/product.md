# Hidden Treasures Dashboard - Product Documentation

## Why This Project Exists

The Hidden Treasures Dashboard was created to solve the operational challenges faced by a sports card consignment business struggling with manual processes, fragmented data, and inefficient workflows. The business was dealing with:

- Scattered information across multiple spreadsheets and systems

- Difficulty tracking sales performance and client relationships
- Manual content management processes
- No centralized system for expense tracking and goal management
