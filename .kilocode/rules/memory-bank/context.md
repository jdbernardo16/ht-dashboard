# Project Context

## Current Work Focus

The Hidden Treasures Dashboard is currently in active development with a fully functional role-based access control system and core business modules. The system supports three distinct user roles (Admin, Manager, VA) with tailored permissions and dashboard views. Recent development has focused on implementing comprehensive dashboard modules with time-period filtering capabilities.

## Recent Changes

1. **Enhanced Dashboard Functionality**: Implemented time-period filtering across all dashboard modules, allowing users to view data by daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, or custom date ranges.

2. **Role-Based Middleware**: Created custom middleware classes (AdminMiddleware, ManagerMiddleware, VAMiddleware) to enforce access control based on user roles.

3. **Database Schema Evolution**: The database has evolved through multiple migrations to support additional features like clients, categories, media management, and notifications.

4. **Frontend Architecture**: Built a modular Vue.js frontend with reusable components for charts, data tables, and form elements.

5. **API Structure**: Implemented a clean API structure with dedicated routes for each business module (tasks, sales, content, expenses, goals).

## Next Steps

1. **Advanced Reporting**: Implement more sophisticated reporting features with export capabilities and custom report generation.

2. **Notification System**: Complete the notification system implementation to provide real-time updates for important events.

3. **File Management**: Enhance the file upload and management system for better media handling across content posts and tasks.

4. **Mobile Optimization**: Further optimize the mobile experience with dedicated mobile views and touch-friendly interactions.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching strategies and database optimizations to handle growing data volumes.

6. **Testing Suite**: Expand the test coverage to include more comprehensive unit and integration tests.

7. **Deployment Pipeline**: Establish a robust CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## Current Technical Debt

1. **Code Duplication**: Some data gathering logic in DashboardController could be refactored into service classes.

2. **Frontend State Management**: Consider implementing a more robust state management solution as the application grows.

3. **API Documentation**: Generate comprehensive API documentation for future integrations.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement more granular error handling and user-friendly error messages.

5. **Accessibility**: Improve accessibility compliance across the application.
