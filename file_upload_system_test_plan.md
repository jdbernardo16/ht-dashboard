# File Upload System Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the file upload system implementation based on the FILE_UPLOAD_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md recommendations.

## Test Environment

-   **Framework**: Laravel 10 + Vue.js 3 + Inertia.js
-   **Storage**: Local filesystem (public disk)
-   **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum
-   **Testing**: PHPUnit for backend, Jest/Vitest for frontend (manual testing)

## Components to Test

### 1. Frontend Components

-   [ ] BaseFileUploader.vue component functionality
-   [ ] useFileUpload.ts composable integration
-   [ ] Content/Create.vue form integration

### 2. Backend Services

-   [ ] FileUploadController endpoints
-   [ ] FileValidationService validation logic
-   [ ] ValidateFileUpload middleware security
-   [ ] ContentPostController integration

### 3. Testing Scenarios

#### Valid File Uploads

-   [ ] Single image upload (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
-   [ ] Multiple file uploads (mixed types)
-   [ ] PDF document upload
-   [ ] Excel/CSV file upload
-   [ ] Video file upload (if supported)

#### Invalid File Uploads

-   [ ] Wrong file types (executables, scripts)
-   [ ] Oversized files (>10MB)
-   [ ] Malicious file names
-   [ ] Corrupted files

#### Edge Cases

-   [ ] Empty file uploads
-   [ ] Drag-and-drop functionality
-   [ ] File removal functionality
-   [ ] Preview generation for images

#### Security Testing

-   [ ] MIME type validation
-   [ ] File extension validation
-   [ ] File size limits
-   [ ] Malicious file detection

### 4. Backward Compatibility

-   [ ] Existing content creation functionality
-   [ ] Media uploads with new system
-   [ ] Database integrity

## Test Data

### Sample Files for Testing

-   **Valid Images**: test-image.jpg (2MB), test-image.png (1.5MB), test-image.webp (800KB)
-   **Valid Documents**: test-document.pdf (500KB), test-spreadsheet.xlsx (300KB), test-data.csv (50KB)
-   **Invalid Files**: test-script.php (malicious), test-executable.exe (blocked), large-file.jpg (15MB)

## Test Execution

### 1. Manual Testing

-   Frontend component interaction
-   User interface validation
-   Error handling and user feedback

### 2. Automated Testing

-   PHPUnit tests for backend validation
-   Integration tests for file processing
-   Security middleware tests

### 3. Performance Testing

-   File upload speed
-   Image processing performance
-   Memory usage during uploads

## Expected Results

### Success Criteria

-   All valid file types should be accepted and processed
-   Invalid files should be rejected with appropriate error messages
-   Files should be stored securely with proper permissions
-   Database records should be created for uploaded files
-   Image previews should be generated for image files
-   Security measures should prevent malicious uploads

### Failure Conditions

-   File uploads failing without proper error messages
-   Security vulnerabilities in file handling
-   Performance issues with large files
-   Database inconsistencies
-   Broken image previews or thumbnails

## Test Reporting

### Metrics to Collect

-   Upload success rate by file type
-   Average processing time per file
-   Error rate and types
-   Security incidents detected
-   Performance benchmarks

### Documentation

-   Test results summary
-   Issues found and severity
-   Recommendations for production
-   Performance optimization suggestions

## Dependencies

-   Laravel storage configuration
-   Image processing library (Intervention Image)
-   Frontend dependencies (VueUse, Lucide icons)
-   Proper file permissions
-   Sufficient storage space

## Risk Assessment

-   **High Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in file upload
-   **Medium Risk**: Performance issues with large files
-   **Low Risk**: UI/UX issues with file upload component

## Timeline

-   Component testing: 2-3 hours
-   Integration testing: 1-2 hours
-   Security testing: 1 hour
-   Performance testing: 1 hour
-   Reporting: 1 hour

## Sign-off Criteria

-   All critical and major issues resolved
-   Security testing passed
-   Performance benchmarks met
-   Documentation completed
-   Stakeholder approval obtained
